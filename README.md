Congrats on completing your JDBC Student Management System (SMS) project! Here's a description you can use for your GitHub repository:

JDBC Student Management System (SMS)
This project is a Student Management System (SMS) developed using Java and JDBC (Java Database Connectivity). It allows users to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on student data stored in a MySQL database. The system is designed to manage student information such as name, roll number, department, and marks.

Features:
Retrieve All Students: Display a list of all students from the database.
Insert a New Student: Add a new student's details into the database.
Update a Student's Information: Update existing student information such as name, department, or marks.
Delete a Student: Remove a student's record from the database using their roll number.
Technologies Used:
Java: Core programming language.
JDBC (Java Database Connectivity): Used for connecting and interacting with the MySQL database.
MySQL: Backend database to store student records.
PreparedStatement: To avoid SQL injection attacks while handling SQL queries.
Scanner: For user input handling.
How It Works:
The application provides a menu-driven interface that allows users to select various options for managing student data.
Each option corresponds to a database operation (CRUD).
Data is validated and then processed in the MySQL database.
